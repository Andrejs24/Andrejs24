About me
--
Greetings, my name is Andrejs Kuramšins, a motivated and passionate developer. In a previous life, I served as a firefighter 👩‍🚒 🚒 , where I had the privilege to rescue people from various situations. This experience has instilled in me a sense of calmness in stressful situations and highlighted the significance of teamwork to achieve remarkable outcomes.

However, life's journey and my profound love for coding 🧑‍💻 eventually led me to embark on a rewarding career as a developer. Embracing the world of programming, I have found my true passion in solving complex problems, crafting innovative solutions, and continuously expanding my knowledge in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

Here you can see my public project, which is Java-based application that allows users to search for flights and plan their travel itineraries. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching flights based on departure and destination airports, as well as departure dates.
